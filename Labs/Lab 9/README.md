# Lab 9

We talked about the steps that we could possibly take to deploy a website. I want you to think about the combination of those things that you would consider if you had to deploy your website. This is a good thinking exercise to do because you gain insight to what all of the different steps entail and are responsible for. Write out what parts you would use below and describe why. It doesn't have to be the most detailed but personally what would you want to do? (I'm not looking for perfect but it should be a working configuration. Assuming all of the website code is done. I don't need to hear about that unless its for the certificate or web server).

I would first make it so that we have a workign server, through a localhost.

I would then prepare and cehck to see if we have hosting ot see if we can deploy the site easily

I wond then set up the DNS recods iwht the database ot get customersd information like login

I would then set up a live testing site to see if it works the way its suppesed to on a live server

I would then set up email accounts, if it is a website that involes moving data form old enmails to the new site.


I woulkd then backup any old inforamtions that sitll needs to, and go live.
